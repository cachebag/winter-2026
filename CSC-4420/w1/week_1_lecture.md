### The Operating System as an Extended Machine

Obviously, working with user facing applications, the interfaces will be advanced, modern and easy to use.

That is not the case when interfacing with Hardware or the OS in general.

### The Operating System as a Resource Manager

**Birds Eye View**
- The OS provides high level, simplified abstractions (file processes, files, memory, etc) to application
  programs, making it easier for developer to write Software.
- Focuses on the services the OS provides to users and applications

**"Under the hood"**
- The OS manages the physical componenets of a complex system(CPU, memory, I/O)
- Provides orderly, controlled allocation of resources to various competing programs to ensure fairness, 
  efficiency and protection.
- Focuses on the internal implementation details and resource management.
